# Demosaicing with Linear Regression

This project is from the CoE 3SK3 Computer Aided Engineering class.

Project definition: Photo sensors cannot differentiate colours and the only way to achieve colour imaging is through threesensor camera, or Colour filter array (CFA). Raw images are captured by this type of camera and creates a mosaic of colours laid out in a Bayer Pattern. Full colour images are digitally restored using demosaicing algorithms. In this project, demosaicing with linear regression is experimented and analyzed.This project explores demosaicing with linear regression.
